                <p id="portfoliocontent">This marketing course focused on the tactics of the most common global social media platforms, mainly Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. During the course, we were assigned to a group project which was based on helping a local bookstore to attract more customers, mainly by focusing on increasing their social media presence. To help them, we analyzed their social media platforms and developed a marketing plan including goals and strategies, target group analysis, tactics for the company’s three platforms, sample content and an editorial calendar.</p>
                
                <p id="portfoliocontent"><i>My role:</i><br> I got to dig deeper into Facebook as a platform as I analyzed the company’s presence, post frequency as well as their followers’ activity on the page. I also developed general goals and strategies as well as sample content based on their needs and general social media recommendations. </p>
                
                <p id="portfoliocontent"><i>What I learned from it:</i><br>
                - Putting together a social media marketing plan.<br>
                - Analyzing a target group to develop primary and secondary example personas.<br>
