                <p id="portfoliocontent">Digital Advertising gave me an insight in modern worldwide digital marketing campaigns, getting perspectives on the industry itself through case studies as well as group discussions surrounding the latest topics. This course also included setting up a potential campaign activation for a company who aimed to reach a narrowed target group. The assignment started with analyzing the company’s background and their product with setting up a perceptual map, as well as analyzing the target audience with demographics and setting up personas. With this in mind, we developed campaign objectives and media objectives, and the outcome resulted in a potential campaign taking place in traditional media and digital media, with focus on AR technique.</p>
                
                <p id="portfoliocontent"><i>My role:</i><br>Me and my three team members collaborated on the overall parts for the campaign case studies as well as with the campaign activation, until we got a result that everyone was satisfied with. The assignments were formed into presentations, so besides the content we also put a big effort on the format and design in our PowerPoint.  </p>
                
                <p id="portfoliocontent"><i>What I learned from it:</i><br>
                - Got knowledge on Google Ads by completing Google Ads Fundamentals. <br>
                - Analyzing digital campaigns through case studies. <br> 
                - Creating a thorough digital campaign in group.
